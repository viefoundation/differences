I Want Better is that “easier” enablement. It’s a new way to deal with the abortion topic. 

Instead of one side or the other, I Want Better enables you to stand for what you believe in, even next to others whose beliefs are not exact to yours. #goodforall

These three words—I Want Better—transform a difficult topic usually navigated by religion, races, and political parties, to a simple and individualized version. The realization that “only I can give myself better” is direly needed in the current status quo of thinking. No government, no church, and no law can give me better. Together, each individually, we can do better. In the formation of sides, we are spending our time and efforts working against each other, instead of working together against a problem. This campaign works to erase the sides, and introduces the enablement of individual application with hope that it will become contagious.

The statement I Want Better is meant to be the residual response to the question “What is your stance on abortion?” It does a few revolutionary alterations to the current stalemate of the topic, while bringing its user to the heart of the matter. 

The Official Icon of the I Want Better campaign is the greater than symbol (>).

This mark was chosen to represent this cause because of its origin and the disposition it conveyed. It was found in the topic itself: Abortion. Turning the capital A on it’s side posed a powerful question—What is better than abortion?—and created a beautiful empty space that was inviting to the user. This is an altogether different disposition than what we currently possess. It is a completely different functionality than that which we find in prochoice and prolife. It is not based on groupthink. Instead of a campaign that tries to provide the answer, it simply provides the question, and goes on to embrace the fact that many answers are needed to truly solve this issue.

Inspiring change and enabling change will lead us to better. Legislation, policy, guilt,appeal to emotional, hate & animosity will not give us better. #inspirechange

Abortion Sucks & So Does Government Control. 

This may be a bit of a juvenile statement, yet it is iconic, and most of all — side transcending. It instantly says I am on neither side. If you let it sink in, it is quite profound. And if not, it is still very catchy. #fresh

So, is this “prochoice” or “prolife”?

I want nothing to do with pro choice vs pro life,*but I do believe we — the human race — can do better than abortion. *or vice versa. If the topic of abortion is being spoken of, these terms are most likely involved. This blurb wants to make it very clear that this campaign is not about any  of these terms, but about the superlative pursuit of better — a very subjective term, yes. The user should be free to use it personally. #notprolife #notprochoice #iwantbetter

The asterisk is there to convey that this blurb is not meant to pick on either of those campaigns in particular. These simple critiques are meant for one thing — timely liberation.

It’s a problem that the word abortion only exists in the context of debate. Why do we see such love, creativity, and progressive thinking applied to other human issues, but not to the issue of unwanted pregnancies? It’s a problem I Want Better aims to solve, first by empowering the individual, then by finding our common ground.

Yet inarguably — WE CAN DO BETTER. 

The entirety of humanity may never completely see eye to eye, but there are commonalities we can embrace and there is a common ground on which we can stand together. What is better? It’s going to be different to every user, but here is a basic beginning list -

MEDICINE is Better. ADOPTION is Better. PEOPLE are Better. CHOICE is Better. 

These examples transcend the boundaries of both sides in a thought provoking, artful and inspirational way. The topic needs this thrust, this allowance. These public service announcements help acheive this. #abortion

Prolife vs Prochoice should not be the only way for us to deal w/the abortion topic. The sides are simply not engineered for the vast majority of public use. We need something that it is. I Want Better aims to fill the need. 7 billion humans pursuing what they personally define as better might seem problematic at first, but it is a friendlier atmosphere for efforts to be applied. The purposeful subjectivity and abstractness of this campaign is meant to bring a paradigm shift that allows all of us, as differing as we may be, to be part of a bigger whole, without the disabling logistics. #7Billion

A Common Goal — LET’S SOLVE OUR NEED FOR ABORTION. Ps. Outlawing is Not Solving. Having a tangible and achievable goal would be a very empowering shift from where we are right now. The current conversation provides only two camps : you are either an advocate of a practice that is simply not our best, or you are an advocate for increase of government control. Neither of these are our best. Think of all the amazing things we have done together as the human race: exploration of the entire earth, the depths of the sea, and outer space, the combustion engine, jet propulsion, news and instant connection to the whole world at the touch of a finger /24 hours a day, cures for age old diseases, racial and gender equality — we should just be able to do better than abortion. I Want Better is a call to the innate, innovative spirit of mankind to discover real solutions to this topic and build a better tomorrow. #HumansCan

PREVENTION is Better. SCIENCE is Better. TECHNOLOGY is Better. Here, the ongoing list of what is better continues. It is important to understand that the I Want Better campaign is not the only purveyor of such information. The individual user provides the answers. The campaign does not supply a guide to the correctness or validity of use. The user is free to decide for themselves. Even if one user looks at another’s answer as absurd, incorrect or ineffective, the campaign enables cooperation to occur. I Want Better sees a growing user base as progression, and that is a better place for us to be. In current society, one can barely talk about this topic productively. That is sad.

ALTERNATIVES are Better. LIFE is Better. WE are Better. The list of what is better is not ruled by extremists or their worldview, but instead it calls to all humanity. It implores us to reach for better, to be our best. Hence, the Official Color of this campaign is Metallic Gold (and other forms of yellow). Gold is a universal reminder to be the best we can be. Go for Gold. #goforgold

INSPIRE CHANGE
It’s a More Worthy Cause than Legislating it 

Real change may never come from any other source. It has been said throughout the years that if you want change, start with yourself. Do! You’re worth it. Others may watch and learn, seeing new possibilities are attainable all by the simple, personal pursuit of individuals wanting better. This can achieve more than a rulebook or law ever could.

INNOVATION >

THIS CAMPAIGN EXISTS TO BE: The Structure & Stability of the World’s Efforts as we Work Step by Step in Solving Our Need for Abortion. The very simple mentality contained in the words “I Want Better” facilitates the ability for us, even in all our differences, to be together under a basic campaign. Starting first and foremost with self, and perhaps self only. I Want Better allows any level of commitment from it’s user. The abortion topic needs such freedom of use. #finally

THIS IS A CAUSE, NOT A DEBATE. 

There is a proverbial foaming at the mouth that occurs between opposing sides when engaged in the current debate. When will we realize that this cause needs our love, our creativity, and if at all possible, our togetherness? This is a cause, not a war against each other. #causenotdebate

THIS IS NOT RELIGION. 

You don’t have to be religious to be a part of or to use the I Want Better campaign. Wanting better and believing humanity is capable of more does not come with the requirements of religion. Whatever you call yourself, whoever you are — I Want Better is for you. You are free to Want better anyway you see fit, and I will do the same. Hopefully there will be 7 billion other users like us. That is change. #iLikeIWantBetter

THIS IS NOT POLITICS. THIS IS FOR YOU. 

This cause is so wrongfully handicapped by the side vs side disposition of world politics. It is imperative that we break free from this. Allowing users the ability to deal with this topic in an effective and productive manner will set the stage for a series of effective solutions. #userfriendly

I Want Better — because myself is all I have control of.
